## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature

### TypeScript Styleguide

* Use type annotations for all function parameters and return types
* Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object types
* Use meaningful variable names
* Document public APIs with JSDoc comments

### React Styleguide

* Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
* Use camelCase for prop names and PascalCase for component names
* Break down large components into smaller, reusable ones
* Use the destructuring syntax for props and state
* Always use the React Fragment shorthand `<>...</>` when possible
